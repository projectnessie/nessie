# Nessie Server Admin Tool

This page explains how to use the Nessie Server Admin Tool to perform repository maintenance tasks
such as:

* Obtaining [information](#repository-information) about a Nessie repository;
* [Exporting](#exporting) a Nessie repository to a ZIP file, e.g. to create a backup;
* [Importing](#importing) a Nessie repository from a ZIP file, e.g. to restore a backup;
* [Migrating](#migrating-from-a-legacy-version-store-type) from a legacy version store type.

## Usage

The Nessie Server Admin Tool requires direct access to the database used by Nessie. The executable is
named `nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar` and can be downloaded from the
[release page on GitHub](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/releases).

!!! note
    The Nessie Server Admin Tool is an executable jar that can be used to interact with a Nessie
    database directly. It should not be confused with the [Nessie CLI tool], which interacts with
    Nessie servers via the REST API.

[Nessie CLI tool]: cli.md

The Nessie Server Admin Tool `nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar` should use the same configuration
settings as the Nessie Quarkus server. These settings should be passed to the tool using
system properties, environment variables or a configuration file. The most relevant settings are
those related to the [database connection](configuration.md#version-store-settings).

A help command is available to list all available commands and options:

```bash
java -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar help
```

### Repository information

The simplest command is `info`, which prints information about the Nessie repository.

For example, here is how to print information about a Nessie repository hosted in a MongoDB
database called `nessie` running on `nessie.example.com:27017`:

```bash
java \
  -Dnessie.version.store.type=MONGODB \
  -Dquarkus.mongodb.database=nessie \
  -Dquarkus.mongodb.connection-string=mongodb://<user>:<password>@nessie.example.com:27017 \
  -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-runner.jar \
  info
```

The output should look similar to this:

```text
No-ancestor hash:                  2e1cfa82b035c26cbbbdae632cea070514eb8b773f616aaeaf668e2f0be8f10d
Default branch head commit ID:     11b5d0f393ad84da4ae9724654d35b96863eda02101f3ff1e633e0b25e0513db
Default branch commit count:       100
Repository description version:    0
Repository description properties:

From configuration:
-------------------
Version-store type:                MONGODB
Default branch:                    main
```

### Exporting

The following command (replace `x.y.z` with the version you're using) exports your Nessie repository
to a single ZIP file called `my-export-file.zip`,

```bash
java -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar export --path my-export-file.zip
```

A ZIP file export contains all necessary repository information in a single, compressed file.
Note that the export will only automatically generate a ZIP file, if the output path ends with
`.zip`, otherwise it will export to a directory. You can force either option using
the `--output-format` option.

!!! note
    Please use the following command for advanced options.
    ```bash
    java -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar help export
    ```

### Importing

The following command (replace `x.y.z` with the version you're using) imports your Nessie repository
from a single ZIP file called `my-export-file.zip`,

```bash
java -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar import --path my-export-file.zip
```

The import will fail, if the target Nessie repository exists and is not empty. If you intentionally
want to overwrite an existing Nessie repository, then use the `--erase-before-import` option.

!!! note
    Please use the following command for advanced options.
    ```bash
    java -jar nessie-server-admin-tool-x.y.z-runner.jar help import
    ```

### Migrating from a legacy version store type

The admin tool can be used to fully migrate a Nessie repository from one version store type to 
another, see [Migration](../guides/migration.md) for a detailed example.

## Building blocks

* Export functionality, based
  on [AbstractNessieExporter](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/blob/main/versioned/transfer/src/main/java/org/projectnessie/versioned/transfer/AbstractNessieExporter.java)
  to dump commits, named references, heads+fork points.
* Import functionality, based
  on [AbstractNessieImporter](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/blob/main/versioned/transfer/src/main/java/org/projectnessie/versioned/transfer/AbstractNessieImporter.java)
  to load the exported data.
* Commit log optimization to:
  * populate the list of parent-commits in all commits, according to the target Nessie repository's
    configuration
  * populate the key-lists in the commits, according to the target Nessie repository's configuration

## Code examples

```java
class CodeExamples {

  void exportExample(Persist persist, Path exportZipFile) {

    ZipArchiveExporter.builder()
      .outputFile(exportZipFile)
      .persist(persist)
      .build()
      .exportNessieRepository();
  }

  void importExample(Persist persist, Path importZipFile) {

    ImportResult importResult =
      ZipArchiveImporter.builder()
        .sourceZipFile(importZipFile)
        .persist(persist)
        .build()
        .importNessieRepository();
  }
}
```

`ZipArchiveImporter` can be replaced with `FileImporter`.

## Export contents

Each export contains this information:

* All commits (no specific order)
* All named references including their heads
* Heads + fork-points (used to feed commit-log optimization ran after a repository import)
* Summary and inventory

## `Content`, `CommitMeta`, global state, et al

A Nessie export contains all `Content` information without any database internal information. This
means that there is no information contained whether the source repository stored `Content` using
e.g. global state. All `Content`s and `CommitMeta` are exported in their public JSON representation.

As a side effect, an export from a Nessie repository with commits that were persisted using global
state will be imported using on-reference-state. However, for content that was persisted using
global state, there will multiple on-reference-states referring to the same Iceberg table-metadata.

## Technical commit information

Exported commits do _not_ contain key-lists or commit-parents or the like, because that is
rather internal, implementation specific information and, additionally, the configuration of the
target repository that controls the aggregated key-lists and commit-parent-lists might be different
from the source repository.

However, exported commits do contain information about the commit-sequence-number and the technical
created-at-timestamp.

!!! note
    The `nessie-server-admin-tool`'s `import` command performs a commit-log optimization after all
    commits and named references have been created. This optimization populates missing
    aggregated key-lists and commit-parents. Running commit-log optimization is necessary for good
    performance to access contents and commit logs, but not strictly necessary.
    Commit-log optimization can be disabled.

## Export contents consistency

Any Nessie export guarantees that the commits referenced by the _named_ references and all their
parent commits are contained in the exported data.

A Nessie export _may_ contain unreferenced commits, for example commits that have been created
while the export is running or commits that are otherwise unreferenced.

The `HEAD`s of the _named_ references and the heads in the `HeadsAndForks` structure may not be
consistent, for example when commits have been created while the export is running.

## Export formats

Exported data can be written either into an empty directory or as a compressed zip file.

Users can optionally zip the contents of an export to a directory and pass that to the zip-file
based importer.
