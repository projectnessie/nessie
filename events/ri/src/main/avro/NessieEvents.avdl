/**
 * A protocol for modelling Nessie events as Avro records.
 *
 * This protocol contains record definitions that map
 * directly to the event types defined in Nessie's
 * org.projectnessie.events.api package.
 *
 * Note: to illustrate how to keep the number of record types low,
 * and hence the number of Avro schemas low, this protocol groups
 * together events that are similar in nature. For example, the
 * ReferenceEvent record corresponds to three different event types
 * in Nessie: ReferenceCreatedEvent, ReferenceDeletedEvent, and
 * ReferenceUpdatedEvent. This grouping is not mandatory, and users
 * are free to define a separate record for each event type if they
 * wish to do so instead.
