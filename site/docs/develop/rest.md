Nessie's REST APIs are how all applications interact with Nessie. The APIs are specified 
according to the openapi v3 standard and are available when running the server by at the path
`/nessie-openapi/openapi.yaml` (for example via `curl http://127.0.0.1:19120/nessie-openapi/openapi.yaml`)
and on the Download/Release pages.
