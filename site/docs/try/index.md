# Getting Started 

For a quick overview of nessie capabilities, several demos which do not require
any special setup except for a web browser have been made available:

* [Nessie and Spark via Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/projectnessie/nessie-demos/main?filepath=colab%2Fnessie-iceberg-demo-nba.ipynb)
* [Nessie and Spark via Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/projectnessie/nessie-demos/blob/main/colab/nessie-iceberg-demo-nba.ipynb)

For people who are interested in trying out all nessie features, they can use
the docker images published with each release and setup the server by following
the instructions available [here](docker.md)
